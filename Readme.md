## GRM_SaveFileParser

*I am building a program, in Python, to import the GRM save file and parse the file. This is merely a proof of concept that it can be done as a side project*

GOALS:

* Export the data into a proper JSON format that can be easily parsed
* Expand the ability to update the data and write back to the GRM save file.
    * The MAIN purpose of this is to expand Web API access to the GRM addon and have it auto-update using web API when the player is offline.
